- Chinese with pinyin:
  Refer to the above demo for translating '命令'.

- Quickly translate the clipboard:

  - When there is text in the clipboard, simply type the trigger keyword `^` to quickly translate the content in the clipboard.

- Specify the target language of translation:

  - Use `^[words]->[target language]`, for example, `^你好->ja` means translate '你好' into Japanese.
    ![Specified language](Images/target%20lan.gif)
    Common language codes:
    |Language|Code|Note|
    |---------|------|-|
    |Chinese(Simplified) | zhs | Simplified Chinese
    |Chinese(Traditional) | zht| Traditional Chinese
    |Japanese |ja| Japanese
    |English |en| English
    |Korean |ko| 한국어
    |French |fr| En français
    |Russian |ru| русск

- Search suggestions:

  - Search content according to the current input suggestions.
    ![suggest](Images/suggest.gif)
  - You can choose whether to enable suggestions in the settings, corresponding to `Enable search suggest`.

- Read content:

  - Supports reading Chinese and English (shortcut key ctrl+enter).
    ![read](Images/read.png)
  - Based on Youdao TTS interface.
  - Supports automatic reading of results function, which is **off by default** and can be turned on in the settings, corresponding to `Automatic reading result`.

- History record:

  - Typing `h` or having no translation target in the clipboard will display translation history.
    ![his](Images/his.png)
  - Default **15** records.
  - **Why doesn't it support customizing the upper limit entry?**
    Because the official only provides a bool type custom parameter, the current version does not support customizing the upper limit of translation history. I will update it when it is supported later. Or you can download the source code and modify it yourself.

- Second Language
  - Enable the second translation target language, disabled by default

  - When enabled, the second language result will be automatically displayed with each translation

## Setting

- If there is a trigger key conflict, modify the default trigger key (it is recommended to modify it to "`" and check for conflicts).
  ![change active key](Images/change_active.png)
- It is recommended to check `Clear previous query at startup`, which can solve the problem that clipboard quick translation cannot be triggered.
  ![auto clean](Images/auto_clean.png)
- It is recommended to check `Smooth input`, which can optimize the input experience.
  ![enable Smooth input](Images/enable%20Smooth%20input.png)
